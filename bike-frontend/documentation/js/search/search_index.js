implementation for the Eiffel Bike Corp system. The application provides a responsive, role-based interface for university members (students/employees) to rent bikes and for the general public to purchase used corporate bikes.\n\n1. Project Overview\n1.1 Context\nThe frontend acts as the primary interface for Université Gustave Eiffel members. It communicates with a JAX-RS (Jersey) backend to manage bike rentals, waiting lists, and a corporate marketplace.\n1.2 Core Objectives\n\nRole-Based Experience: Tailored UI based on user type (Student, Employee, Corp, or Ordinary).\nReactive State: Utilization of Angular Signals for real-time UI synchronization (basket, user profile, and history).\nSeamless Payments: Integrated checkout flow supporting currency conversion snapshots.\nTransparency: Direct access to bike condition history and return notes.\n\n\n2. Technology Stack\n\nFramework: Angular 17+ (Standalone Components)\nState Management: Angular Signals & Computed Properties\nStyling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first framework)\nSecurity: JWT Authentication with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\nCommunication: RxJS & HttpClient\n\n\n3. Architecture & Routing\n3.1 Route Configuration\nThe application uses a hybrid routing strategy with a Mainlayout providing a persistent navigation sidebar for authorized users.\n\n\n\nPath\nComponent\nRole Protection\n\n\n\n\n/\nLandingComponent\nPublic\n\n\n/login\nLoginpage\nPublic\n\n\n/dashboard\nDashboard\nStudent, Employee\n\n\n/rentals\nMyrentals\nStudent, Employee\n\n\n/sales\nMarketplaceComponent\nStudent, Employee, Ordinary\n\n\n/offer\nOfferBikeComponent\nStudent, Employee, Corp\n\n\n\n3.2 Security: Role Guard\nAccess is enforced via the roleGuard functional guard. It intercepts navigation by:\n\nToken Check: Verifying the existence of a JWT in localStorage.\nBase64 Decoding: Extracting the type (role) from the JWT payload without a backend round-trip.\nPermission Check: Matching the user role against the allowedRoles defined in the route data.\n\n\n4. Key Component Logic\n4.1 User Service (UserService)\nThe central hub for identity. It uses Signals to expose the current user globally. \n\nIt handles login() by storing the JWT and setUserFromToken() to decode user details (ID, Name, Role) for immediate UI reactivity.\n\n4.2 Marketplace & Basket (MarketplaceComponent)\nImplements the resale flow (US_12–US_19).\n\nSignal-based Totals: The totalEur is a computed signal that updates automatically as the basket changes.\nBusiness Rule Enforcement: Includes logic to prevent users from adding their own listed bikes to their basket.\nCheckout Workflow: Transitions the user from a browsing state to a Purchase state, locking in the price snapshot before calling the payment API.\n\n4.3 Rentals & History (Myrentals)\nManages the university rental lifecycle (US_21).\n\nUnified Dashboard: Displays active rentals and waitlist status in one view.\nReturn Logic: Collects bike condition and comments, which are then pushed to the backend to notify the next person on the FIFO waiting list.\n\n4.4 Offering Flow (OfferBikeComponent)\nThe provider interface for listing inventory.\n\nConditional UI: Shows the \"List for Sale\" option only for corporate bikes that meet the \"previously rented\" criteria.\nBike History: Allows providers to see all past notes left by renters to track wear and tear.\n\n\n5. UI/UX Implementation\n5.1 Responsive Layout\nThe Mainlayout features a responsive sidebar that adapts to different screen sizes. It uses routerLinkActive to provide visual feedback on the current location.\n5.2 Interaction Design\n\nModals & Drawers: Used for checkout and bike details to keep the user in context.\nAlert System: A centralized alert signal provides consistent feedback for success/error states across all forms.\n\n\n6. Integration Notes\n6.1 Authentication Header\nMost service calls utilize a private helper to inject the Bearer token:\nExample :private getHeaders() {\n  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');\n  return new HttpHeaders().set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);\n}6.2 State Persistence\nUser session data is mirrored in localStorage to ensure the application remains authenticated upon browser refresh, with UserService re-initializing the signals on startup.\n7. How to Run\nExample :npm install\nng serve\nhttp://localhost:4200Appendix A. User Manual\nWelcome to the Eiffel Bike Corp platform. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the system based on your user profile (Student, Employee, or External Buyer).\n\n1. Getting Started\n1.1 Registration & Login\n\nNavigate to the Landing Page (/).\nClick Join Now to create an account.\nSelect your profile type:\nStudent/Employee: Required for renting bikes and offering bikes.\nOrdinary: For external users who only wish to purchase corporate bikes.\n\n\nOnce registered, log in via the Login page to receive your access token.\n\n\n2.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\nQ: Can I buy my own bike? > A: No. The system prevents users from adding their own listed bikes to their shopping basket.\nQ: How does the waiting list work? > A: It follows a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) rule. The first person to join the list gets the bike the moment the previous renter returns it.\nQ: Can I pay in USD? > A: Yes. While the system operates in EUR, the payment gateway handles conversion automatically using a real-time FX snapshot.\n\n\n6. Support & Troubleshooting\n\nToken Expired: If you are suddenly redirected to the login page, your session has expired. Please log in again.\nUnauthorized Access: If a menu item is missing, your user profile (e.g., Ordinary) may not have permission to access that
